Subject: Request for Correction of Biometric Punch-in Time Discrepancy

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to bring to your attention a discrepancy in my biometric punch-in time on [date]. According to the records, I am marked as punching in at 2:36 PM, whereas the actual time I punched in was 1:36 PM.

To support my claim, I have attached a screenshot of my work snap taken at the time of punch-in, clearly indicating the correct time. I understand the importance of accurate timekeeping, and I believe this discrepancy may impact my total work hours.

I kindly request your assistance in rectifying this error in the system and updating my biometric punch-in time for [date] to reflect the accurate time of 1:36 PM.

I appreciate your prompt attention to this matter, and I am available to provide any additional information or clarification if needed.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.

Best regards,
[Your Full Name]
